# Node-RED Essentials 
In this lab you will learn how to build a text analyzer using Node-RED essentials techniques. We will be using drag and drop nodes with Watson APIs to analyze and gain useful insights. We be using services such as tone analyzer, text to speech , audio output , language translator and twitter data source.
